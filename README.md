# NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Analysis

This project analyzes motor vehicle collision data from New York City to uncover key patterns, trends, and geospatial insights that can inform safer road designs and policies.

---

## Overview

- Use publicly available NYC “Motor Vehicle Collisions – Crashes” data 
- Explore temporal trends (e.g., time of day, day of week) in collision frequency.  
- Analyze contributing factors (e.g., driver inattention, weather, road conditions).  
- Map collision hotspots on a geospatial map.  
- Investigate severity (number of injuries or fatalities) across different areas.
